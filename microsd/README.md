This folder contains files that should be placed on microsd card.
That is:

1. Rootfs tarball. Configurable via "TARBALL" variable in skel.installer.sh
2. Linux kernel/initrd blob. Jhinta's rootbind kernel is intended to be used with a modified kernel option (bind and rw)
3. *.installer.sh installer script.
