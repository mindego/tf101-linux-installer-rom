# tf101-linux-installer-rom
Flashable linux installer for Asus Transformer TF101/TF101G

It does not contain Linux RootFS. 
Such rootfs should be placed on microSD.

The name of such rootfs tarball is controllable via installer.sh file.

Installer script requires kernel.gz file and it should be Linux kernel.
I think it is possible to use Android kernel, but that needs additional checks.
